Once upon a time there was a witch named Caren who lived in the mountains of Italy.
She loved pasta, and all the time she would make pasta for the nearby village,
feeding everyone with her magic pasta pot. Everyone loved this witch, despite her wretched looks and crackly voice. 

One day the witch was cooking up a real good batch of spaghetti to give to the villagers of the Italian Dolomites. She watched as they enjoyed her pasta with gusto. Savoring every bite. After the meal was over they all thanked her but then
something started to happen. All the villagers became violently ill. The witch became extremely nervous...she did not mean to do this to them! Who had 
sabotoged her???

She remembered she had a rival who was a wizard who lived across the river. She decided to treck over the river and confront Mr. Wizard. She had done wrong to
him in her evil past, and thought he was trying to only now get revenge.

Mr.Wizard was very surprised seeing Caren coming towards his house, since they haven't talked to each other in 300 years. He had already forgiven her
and he was always willing to talk with her again and maybe make friends with her.
